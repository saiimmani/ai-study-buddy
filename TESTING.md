## üìä Test Sample Data

### For Concept Explainer:
```
What is mitochondria?
Explain Newton's first law of motion
What is the difference between DNA and RNA?
```

### For Note Summarizer & Quiz/Flashcards:
Use the provided `sample_notes.txt` or paste this:

```
The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapor, and ice at various stages of the cycle. The main processes include evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Solar energy drives the cycle by evaporating water from the surface of the ocean. This water vapor rises and cools, condensing into clouds. Eventually, the water falls back to Earth as precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail). Some of this precipitation flows into rivers and streams, eventually returning to the ocean, while some soaks into the ground, replenishing aquifers.
```
